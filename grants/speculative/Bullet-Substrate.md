# Bullet-Substrate tool
## Project Description
This project is an privacy-protecting tool kit fot parachain based on the bullet-proof protocol. Bullet-Substrate tool is basically designed as a privacy tool for blockchain based on Substrat to impletement privacy transaction. 

The comparison of bullet-proof and other privacy techniques can be found here :https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf


The outstanding features of Bulletchain are following:

* according to the features of Bullet-proof, we do not need any trusted party or MPC to do pre-setup

* according to the features of Bullet-proof, with shorted proof, the tool kit will be specially suitable for the  parachain in which the resource consume money

* The enhancement for the Bullet-proof time consuming 
    
* This project is the first privacy implemet for account module based on Bullet-proof 

* Customized develent for bullet-proof for substrate

The high level principle is as follows.

## Team's experience
Newstyle tech corporation is a comprehensive corporation for live boardcast, blockchain, exchanges.Blockchain department is devided into some separeted projects, like public chain and tool kit for some famous pbulic chain. Bullet-Substrate is a privacy tool kit project specific for polkadot. 

Prof Yongge Wang is currently a full-time professor at the University of North Carolina at CharlotteProfessor. Wang's proposed post-quantum cryptographic algorithm RLCE has been selected as a candidate for the post-quantum standard of the NIST. In addition, Professor Wang has been actively involved in the development of a large number of protocol standards: for example, IETF, W3C XML protocol, IEEE 1363 protocol and SAN Internet Security Protocol.In this project, Prof Yongge Wang is responsible for the optimization for the Bullet-proof


Dr.Yunchuan Wei worked as a rocket engneer for the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, and reponsible for the , in this project, Dr.Yunchuan Wei will responsible for the software arctecture, and safety aspect.

## Development Roadmap
The milestones are spread out over a total of 3 months as following:

* M1: Implementation of the optimization for the Bullet-proof protocol (3 weeks)
* M2: Construct blockchain called BulletChain based on substrate, and a simple wallet(1 week)
* M3: Implementation of value atransaction fee to (2 weeks)
* M4: Implementation of privacy transactions(4 weeks)
