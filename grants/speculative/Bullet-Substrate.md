# Bullet-Substrate tool
## Project Description
This project is an privacy-protecting tool kit for parachain based on the Bullet-proof protocol. Bullet-Substrate tool is basically designed as a privacy tool for blockchain based on Substrate to impletement private transaction. 

The comparison of Bullet-proof and other privacy techniques can be found [Sonic: Zero-Knowledge SNARKs from Linear-Size Universal and Updatable Structured Reference Strings](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf) 


The outstanding features of Bullet-Substrate are as following:

* According to the features of Bullet-proof, we do not need any trusted party or MPC to do pre-setup

* According to the features of Bullet-proof, with shorted proof, the tool kit will be specially suitable for the  parachain where the the use of the resource (for example storage and code execution) may consume money

* The enhancement for time complexity in the Bullet-proof
    
* This project is the first Private transaction impletementation for account module based on Bullet-proof protocol

* Customized development for Bullet-proof for substrate

The high level principle is as follows.
