# Bullet-Zokrates tool
## Project Description
2018 Jacob Eberhardt and Stefan Tai, Ph.D. students from the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, proposed a processing framework [Zokrates](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg308/publications/2018/2018_eberhardt_ZoKrates.pdf) based on zk-snarks for off-chain computing/on-chain verification and provided a toolchain for the entire framework on Ethereum. The off-chain computing/on-chain verification framework can be used to 

* Provide privacy 
* Reduce data storage on the chain 
* Reduce the amount of computation on the chain.

This project is an analogous famework based on Bullet-proof and provide toolchain for the parachain in polkadot, to enhancement the Scalability and can be used as an expansion mechanism  

The outstanding features of Bullet-Zokrates are following:

* Comprared with Zokrates, Bullet-Zokrates do not need any trusted party or MPC to do pre-setup
* Comprared with Zokrates, the proof in the Bullet-Zokrates is more shorter
* Provide toolchain for the entire framework on Parachain

The high level principle is as follows(which is form the paper of the Zokrates, but can also illustrate the points).

## Development Roadmap
The milestones are spread out over a total of almost 3 months as following:


* M1: Realize a new Zokrates module in which the proof-of-concept implementation uses the parachain (3 weeks) 

* M2: Implementation a Zokrates called Bullet-Zokrates based on the Bullet-proof protocol based on the result of M1 (4 weeks)


* M3: Construct toolchain for the parachain in polkadot (4 week)

In the long term, on one hand,  we will do more enhancement of our toolchain to be compatible with other circuit generation languages , on the other hand, we will do more research on the method of optimization of the bullet-proof.
