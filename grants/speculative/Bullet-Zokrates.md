# Bullet-Zokrates tool
## Project Description
2018 Jacob Eberhardt and Stefan Tai, Ph.D. students from the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, proposed a processing framework [Zokrates](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg308/publications/2018/2018_eberhardt_ZoKrates.pdf) based on zk-snarks for off-chain computing/on-chain verification and provided a toolchain for the entire framework on Ethereum. The off-chain computing/on-chain verification
framework can be used to 

* Provide privacy 
* Reduce data storage on the chain 
* Reduce the amount of computation on the chain.





This project is an analogous famework based on Bullet-proof and provide toolchain for the parachain in polkadot, to enhancement the Scalability and can be used as a expansio nmechanism  


The outstanding features of Bullet-Zokrates are following:

* Based on the features of Bullet-proof, we do not need any trusted party or MPC to do pre-setup
* Based on the features of Bullet-proof, the proof is more shorted than zksnark
* provide toolchain for the entire framework parachain

The high level principle is as follows(which is form the paper of the Zokrates, but can also illustrate the points).

## Team's experience
Newstyle tech corporation is a comprehensive corporation for live boardcast, blockchain, exchanges.Blockchain department is devided into some separeted projects, like public chain and tool kit for some famous pbulic chain. Bullet-Substrate is a privacy tool kit project specific for polkadot. 

Prof Yongge Wang is currently a full-time professor at the University of North Carolina at CharlotteProfessor. Wang's proposed post-quantum cryptographic algorithm RLCE has been selected as a candidate for the post-quantum standard of the NIST. In addition, Professor Wang has been actively involved in the development of a large number of protocol standards: for example, IETF, W3C XML protocol, IEEE 1363 protocol and SAN Internet Security Protocol.In this project, Prof Yongge Wang is responsible for the optimization for the Bullet-proof


Dr.Yunchuan Wei worked as a rocket engneer for the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, and reponsible for the , in this project, Dr.Yunchuan Wei will responsible for the software arctecture, and safety aspect.

## Development Roadmap
The milestones are spread out over a total of 3 months as following:

* M1: Implementation a new Zokrates called Bullet-Zokrates based on the Bullet-proof protocol refer to Zokrates (3 weeks)
* M2: Construct toolchain for the parachain in polkadot (1 week)
