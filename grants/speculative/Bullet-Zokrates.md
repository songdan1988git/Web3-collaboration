# Bullet-Zokrates tool
## Project Description
2018 Jacob Eberhardt and Stefan Tai, Ph.D. students from the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, proposed a processing framework [Zokrates](https://www.ise.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg308/publications/2018/2018_eberhardt_ZoKrates.pdf) based on zk-snarks for off-chain computing/on-chain verification and provided a toolchain for the entire framework on Ethereum. The off-chain computing/on-chain verification framework can be used to 

* Provide privacy 
* Reduce data storage on the chain 
* Reduce the amount of computation on the chain.

This project is an analogous famework based on Bullet-proof and provide toolchain for the parachain in polkadot, to enhancement the Scalability and can be used as an expansion mechanism  

The outstanding features of Bullet-Zokrates are following:

* Comprared with Zokrates, Bullet-Zokrates do not need any trusted party or MPC to do pre-setup
* Comprared with Zokrates, the proof in the Bullet-Zokrates is more shorter
* Provide toolchain for the entire framework on Parachain

The high level principle is as follows(which is form the paper of the Zokrates, but can also illustrate the points).
